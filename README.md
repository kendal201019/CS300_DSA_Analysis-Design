# CS300_DSA_Analysis-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem addressed in the projects for this course was to develop an advising assistance software for the Computer Science department at ABCU. This software needed to handle various tasks such as loading course data, sorting and printing courses, and displaying course information. The overarching goal was to demonstrate proficiency in applying data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In my approach, I first analyzed the requirements and identified the key functionalities required. Then, I approached the problem by designing and implementing appropriate data structures and algorithms to efficiently handle tasks such as loading course data from files, sorting and printing courses, and retrieving course information. Understanding data structures was crucial because they provide efficient ways to organize and manipulate data, leading to optimized performance and resource utilization.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the project, the first roadblock encountered was deciding which data structure to use for storing course information and implementing the sorting algorithm for printing courses in order. To solves these challenges, I reviewed course materials and researched the subject. By breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and systematically addressing each one, I was able to overcome these roadblocks and make progress towards completing the project.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by emphasizing the importance of modularity, efficiency, and scalability. I learned to design software components that are modular and encapsulated, allowing for easier maintenance, debugging, and reuse. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of algorithmic complexity and its impact on the performance of software systems, leading to more informed design decisions.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through this project, I developed a greater appreciation for writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. I learned to design programs that are adaptable to future changes and enhancements by incorporating flexible architectures and modular design principles.
